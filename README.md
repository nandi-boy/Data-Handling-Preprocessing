#  Data Preprocessing Practice

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled **`Data Preprocessing.ipynb`**, created for essential **data handling and preprocessing techniques** in Machine Learning.  
The notebook demonstrates step-by-step data cleaning, transformation, and preparation methods required before building predictive models.

## 📘 Overview

Data preprocessing is a crucial phase in any data science or machine learning project.  
This notebook covers the complete workflow — from handling raw, messy data to producing a clean and ready-to-use dataset.

The focus is on understanding and implementing common preprocessing operations using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Scikit-learn**.

## 🧩 Topics Covered

1. **Handling Missing Values**
   - Identifying missing data
   - Imputation techniques (mean, median, mode, constant values)
   - Dropping missing data where necessary

2. **Outlier Handling**
   - Detecting outliers using statistical methods (IQR, Z-score)
   - Treating or capping outliers appropriately

3. **Encoding Categorical Data**
   - Label Encoding
   - One-Hot Encoding
   - Ordinal Encoding for ordered categories

4. **Feature Scaling**
   - Standardization (Z-score normalization)
   - Min-Max Scaling

5. **Feature Selection**
   - Correlation-based feature removal

6. **Train-Test Split**
   - Splitting dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`
   - Ensuring proper randomization and reproducibility

8. **Handling Imbalanced Dataset**
   - Understanding class imbalance
   - Oversampling 
   - Undersampling
   - Evaluating balanced vs. imbalanced model performance

## 🛠️ Libraries and Tools Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Imbalanced-learn (imblearn)** for oversampling and undersampling techniques
